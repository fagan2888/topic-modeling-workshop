# Topic Modeling References

Two good bibliographies for topic modeling are those by [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/topics.html)
and [Quentin Plepl√©](http://qpleple.com/bib/) .

The following articles by Blei et al are fundamental for LDA.

machine Learning research, 3(Jan), 993-1022.

* Blei, D. M. (2012). [Probabilistic topic models.](https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/4/147361-probabilistic-topic-models/fulltext?mobile=true) Communications of the ACM, 55(4),
77-84.

This article by Lee and Seung is fundamental for NNMF.

The following two articles by Jockers and Underwood are written with humanities scholars 
in mind and are relatively non-technical. 

* Jockers, Matthew L. 2011. [The LDA Buffet is Now Open; or, Latent Dirichlet Allocation for English Majors.](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2011/09/29/the-lda-buffet-is-now-open-or-latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-english-majors/)

* Underwood, Ted. 2012. [Topic modeling made just simple enough.](https://tedunderwood.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/)

This 1974 article by Howard P. Iker details the early uses (starting about 1960) of principal components analysis for topic extraction from text.
