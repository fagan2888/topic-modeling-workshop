Looking at Topic #01, we can see there are many first names clustered into the same category, along with the word “interview”.

Second, Topic #02 focuses on assault terms, such as “murder”, “stabbing”, “guilty”, and “killed”. This is an interesting split between the topics because although the terms in each are very closely related, one focuses more on police-related activity, and the other more on criminal activity. Along with the first cluster which obtain first-names, the results show that NMF (using TfIdf) performs much better than LDA on this set of texts."
