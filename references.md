# Topic Modeling References

Two good bibliographies for topic modeling are those by [David Mimno](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/topics.html)
and [Quentin Pleplé](http://qpleple.com/bib/) .

The following articles by Blei et al are fundamental for LDA.

* Blei, D. M., Ng, A. Y., & Jordan, M. I. (2003). [Latent dirichlet allocation.](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/blei03a.html) Journal of
machine Learning research, 3(Jan), 993-1022.

* Blei, D. M. (2012). [Probabilistic topic models.](https://m-cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/4/147361-probabilistic-topic-models/fulltext?mobile=true) Communications of the ACM, 55(4),
77-84.

This article by Lee and Seung is fundamental for NNMF.

The following two articles by Jockers and Underwood are written with humanities scholars 
in mind and are relatively non-technical. 

* Jockers, Matthew L. 2011. [The LDA Buffet is Now Open; or, Latent Dirichlet Allocation for English Majors.](http://www.matthewjockers.net/2011/09/29/the-lda-buffet-is-now-open-or-latent-dirichlet-allocation-for-english-majors/)

* Underwood, Ted. 2012. [Topic modeling made just simple enough.](https://tedunderwood.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/)

This 1974 article by Howard P. Iker details the early uses (starting about 1960) of principal components analysis for topic extraction from text.

The climate change twitter data come originally from [data.world.](https://data.world/crowdflower/sentiment-of-climate-change)
We are working with a version of the data reformatted by [James at the Coding Club.](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2018/12/10/topic-modelling-python.html)
as well as a modified version of his sample code.
